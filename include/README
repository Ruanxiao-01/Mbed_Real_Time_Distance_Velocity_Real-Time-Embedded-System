# The Need for Speed - ECE-GY 6483 Embedded Challenge

## Project Overview
This project, "The Need for Speed," is developed by Group 1 for the ECE-GY 6483 Embedded Challenge. It features a system that measures and records gyroscopic data to calculate linear velocity and distance traveled. This data is then displayed on an LCD screen attached to the STM32F429ZI development board.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Mbed OS
- STM32F429ZI development board
- Gyroscope sensor
- Required Libraries: `LCD_DISCO_F429ZI`, `mbed.h`, `cmath`, `chrono`

### Hardware Setup
1. Connect the gyroscope sensor to the STM32F429ZI board following the designated pin configuration.
2. Ensure the LCD screen is properly connected and configured.

### Software Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project using an Mbed-compatible IDE or compiler.
3. Compile the code and upload it to the STM32F429ZI board.

## Usage
1. Press the button on the board to start the recording phase.
2. Perform the motion or gesture to be measured.
3. The system will record the gyroscopic data and calculate the linear velocity and total distance traveled.
4. This data is displayed on the LCD screen.
5. Press the button again to reset or restart the measurement process.

## File Structure
- `main.cpp`: Contains the main logic and flow control for the data recording and processing.
- `LCD_DISCO_F429ZI.h`: Library for controlling the onboard LCD display.

## Features
- Real-time gyroscopic data measurement.
- Calculation of linear velocity and distance traveled.
- Data visualization on an LCD screen.
- Reset and restart functionality for repeated measurements.

## Troubleshooting
- LCD Display Issues: Ensure the LCD is correctly connected and initialized in the code.
- Sensor Data Accuracy: Verify the gyroscope sensor is calibrated and functioning correctly.
